I am a student at NWMSU Graduate Student majoring in Applied Computer Science. Through my education I have learned a wide variety of programming languages and gained team skills as well as a willingness to learn new things and humility to admit when I donâ€™t know something. I graduated with my first BS in May 2021 and plan to complete my Masters in December of 2022

In my free time I enjoy doing a variety of things including but not limited to playing video games, watching TV, playing music(guitar, piano, ukelele), golf, origami, and a many different puzzles similar to that of the traditional Rubik's Cube.
